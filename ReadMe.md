">be me" is a small text adventure game in the style of a 4chan greentext, [hosted on Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/704081).

I'm archiving those code publicly. People can use it as reference for its architecture (which I think is suitable for small-medium text adventure games). 

The fixed-width bitmap shader is also interesting, albeit not how I would recommend rendering bitmap fonts nowadays.
