">be me" is a small text adventure game in the style of a 4chan greentext, [hosted on Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/704081).

I'm archiving this code publicly, as-is, including the random psd at the root (idk). 
It was completed in under 24 work-hours, so it's not the prettiest, but hopefully it'll help someone.

People can use it as reference for its architecture (which I think is suitable for small-medium text adventure games). 

The fixed-width bitmap shader is also interesting, albeit not how I would recommend rendering bitmap fonts nowadays.

It also makes use of the [newgrounds.io For Unity](https://bitbucket.org/newgrounds/newgrounds.io-for-unity-c/) Library for achievements.
